/**
 * (Game: play a tic-tac-toe game) In a game of tic-tac-toe,
 * two players take turns marking an available cell in a 3 * 3
 * grid with their respective tokens (either X or O). When one
 * player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or
 * diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has
 * won. A draw (no winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid
 * have been filled with tokens and neither player has achieved a
 * win. Create a program for playing tic-tac-toe. The program
 * prompts two players to enter an X token and O token alternately.
 * Whenever a token is entered, the program redisplays the board on
 * the console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue).
 * 
 * Hint: Use a 2-dimensional array to hold the scoreboard in memory.
