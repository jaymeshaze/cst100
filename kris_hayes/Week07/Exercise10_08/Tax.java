/**
 * (Financial: the Tax class) Programming Exercise 8.12 writes a program
 * for computing taxes using arrays. Design a class named Tax to contain
 * the following instance data fields:
 *
 *	- int filingStatus: One of the four tax-filing statuses: 0—single filer,
 *		1— married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er), 2—married filing separately,
 *		and 3—head of household. Use the public static constants SINGLE_FILER (0),
 *		MARRIED_JOINTLY_OR_QUALIFYING_WIDOW(ER) (1), MARRIED_ SEPARATELY (2),
 *		HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD (3) to represent the statuses.
 *	- int[][] brackets: Stores the tax brackets for each filing status.
 *	- double[] rates: Stores the tax rates for each bracket.
 *	- double taxableIncome: Stores the taxable income.
 *
 * Provide the getter and setter methods for each data field and the
 * getTax() method that returns the tax. Also provide a no-arg constructor
 * and the constructor Tax(filingStatus, brackets, rates, taxableIncome).
 * Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 * 
 * Write a test program that uses the Tax class to print the 2001 and 2009
 * tax tables for taxable income from $50,000 to $60,000 with intervals of
 * $1,000 for all four statuses. The tax rates for the year 2009 were given
 * in Table 3.2. The tax rates for 2001 are shown in Table 10.1.
